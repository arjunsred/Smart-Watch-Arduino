Arduino Smart Watch

Smart watch made with arduino. It took a whole to complete 
the code. The wirings are simple. It was inspired by tinkernut.
The whole code was written by me. Please check out the wiring 
schematics too.Some version are a litte rusty and 
some do not work. But the version 4 is the latest and works 
well. The four versions are very different from each other.
