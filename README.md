Arduino Smart Watch

This smart watch is made with arduino.It can show time, date, temperature,
humidity, steps, distance. The possibilities are endless! It took a whole week 
to complete the code. The wirings are quite simple. It was inspired by tinkernut.

The whole code was written by me. Please check out the wiring 
schematics too. The former versions are a litte rusty and some do not work.
But version 4 is the latest and works quite well. In the future, I plan 
to add more features.
