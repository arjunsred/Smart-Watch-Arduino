Arduino Smart Watch

This smart watch made with arduino. It took a whole week to complete 
the code. The wirings are  quite simple. It was inspired by tinkernut.
Please check out his video here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfmwhabTVB4]
The whole code was written by me. Please check out the wiring 
schematics too. The former versions are a litte rusty and some do not work.
But version 4 is the latest and works  quite well. 
The four versions are very different from each other.
